# Java Data Structures and Algorithms

Welcome to the Java Data Structures and Algorithms project! This repository is a playground for implementing various data structures and algorithms in Java, organized in a modular and beginner-friendly manner.

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `src`: Contains all the Java source files.
- `lib`: Houses project dependencies.
- `bin`: Automatically generated folder for compiled output files.

> **Pro Tip**: If you'd like to customize the folder structure, edit `.vscode/settings.json`.

## 📋 Class Overview

### 1. `CircularLinkedList`
**Topic**: Circular Linked List  
Implements a linked list where the last node points back to the head, forming a circle. Great for applications like round-robin scheduling.  
🌀 *Who needs a start or end when everything is a loop?*

---

### 2. `CircularQueue`
**Topic**: Circular Queue  
Efficient implementation of a queue where the rear can wrap around to the front. Perfect for optimizing memory usage.  
🚦 *Life's a circle, even in queues!*

---

### 3. `DoublyLinkedList`
**Topic**: Doubly Linked List  
Allows traversal in both directions, forwards and backwards. Useful for undo operations in text editors.  
🔄 *Sometimes, it's okay to look back.*

---

### 4. `HashTable_1`, `HashTable_2`, `HashTable_3`, `HashTable`
**Topic**: Hash Tables  
Implementations of hash tables with different collision resolution techniques like chaining and open addressing.  
🔑 *Find your key in constant time, unless it's lost in a collision!*

---

### 5. `Node`
**Topic**: Node Structure  
Defines the basic building block for linked lists and trees.  
📦 *Small but mighty—like a LEGO brick for data structures.*

---

### 6. `Queue`
**Topic**: Queue  
A basic implementation of the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure.  
🍔 *First come, first served—just like a burger queue!*

---

### 7. `SinglyLinkedList`
**Topic**: Singly Linked List  
A simple linked list where each node points to the next.  
➡️ *One direction—not the band.*

---

### 8. `SortAlgorithms`
**Topic**: Sorting Algorithms  
Collection of sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort.  
📈 *Because life's better when it's sorted.*

---

### 9. `SortedLinkedList`
**Topic**: Sorted Linked List  
Maintains elements in sorted order as they're added.  
🗂️ *Always keeps things in order.*

---

### 10. `Stack`
**Topic**: Stack  
Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure, like a stack of plates.  
📚 *Don't forget to put the dishes back!*

---

### 11. `Static_Queue` and `Static_Stack`
**Topic**: Static Implementations  
Fixed-size implementations of queues and stacks using arrays.  
📏 *Size matters—especially when it's fixed.*
